      "1980s retro-futuristic synth film score. NOT meditation. Sustained analog synth pads with heavy, static harmonic weight, restrained and unresolved, cold urban undertone. Solitary, metallic restraint, like standing alone in a future city at night where time feels suspended. No rhythm, no pulse, no melody, no relaxation intent. Background-first, loopable unnoticed.",

    description:
      "Heavy sustained analog synth, dark with cold urban undertone. Unresolved and inevitable — emotion remains suspended. Low harmonic pad/drone optional. Time-suspended, not moving forward. Retro-futuristic noir stripped of drama: presence, not spectacle. No rhythm, no drums, no vocals, no melody. Solitary, nocturnal, metallic restraint. Film score, NOT meditation.",

      "Film score, NOT meditation. Very minimal sustained analog synth pads, heavy static harmonic weight, cold urban undertone. Emotionally neutral — not calming, not motivating. Designed to stay in the background, loop unnoticed. No rhythm, no pulse, no drums, no vocals, no melody. Solitary presence, metallic restraint.",
