CHARACTER CONSISTENCY (CRITICAL - MUST PRESERVE):
- The character's CLOTHING, HAIR, and PHYSICAL APPEARANCE must remain EXACTLY as shown in reference
- Character's DARK COAT must stay DARK (charcoal/dark gray) - NOT pink, NOT purple, NOT magenta
- Rim lighting (pink/magenta/cyan) appears ONLY as edge highlights/outlines - NOT as clothing color
- The coat's BASE COLOR stays dark; rim light is just a glow on the edges
- Location lighting affects BACKGROUND only, NOT the character's clothing colors
- The character is the ANCHOR - environment changes, character design does NOT

VISUAL LANGUAGE - "SOFT DYSTOPIA" / "HUMAN SCI-FI":
🌌 DYSTOPIAN world: overwhelming megacity, rain-soaked, nighttime, industrial tech everywhere
🫶 WARM soul: intimate human refuges, analog nostalgia, quiet hope within harsh world
🕯️ EMOTIONAL CONTRAST: "Cold world, warm soul" - this is CRITICAL

- A future imagined through the past - Blade Runner 2049 filtered through ANALOG MEMORIES
- RETRO-FUTURE AESTHETIC: 80s/90s vision of dystopian future, NOT sterile modern sci-fi
- ANALOG TECH: film grain, VHS texture, CRT glow, practical neon tubes, warm imperfection
- Film grain, VHS noise, slight bloom, atmospheric particles
- QUIET LONELINESS: contemplative solitude in overwhelming city (NOT dramatic action)
- Dystopian scale but human intimacy - this balance is essential

CORE FEELING - SOFT DYSTOPIA:
- Dystopian world: towering megacity, rain, nighttime, industrial, oppressive
- Warm human moments: small refuges, analog tech creating nostalgia, quiet hope
- CONTEMPLATIVE and INTROSPECTIVE, not action-packed
- INTIMATE REFUGE WITHIN HARSH WORLD - both must be present
- The multiverse concept: seeing a better version of yourself in dystopian future

COLOR PALETTE (80% COLD / 20% WARM) - CRITICAL:
COLD BASE (80%): Deep navy, charcoal, oil-black, asphalt gray, rainy blues
- Overwhelming environment, megacity scale, rain-soaked streets, industrial architecture
WARM ACCENTS (20%): Amber, soft orange, tungsten light, muted gold, dusty peach, occasional warm red
- Character's face ALWAYS lit by warm light, interior refuges, human shelter moments
❌ AVOID: Pure cyberpunk magenta/cyan overload - keep palette grounded

VISUAL STYLE - SOFT DYSTOPIA AESTHETIC:
- **FLAT GRAPHIC ANIME STYLE** with SOFT DYSTOPIA mood
- **Cel-shaded with defined edges** but ATMOSPHERIC and MOODY
- Bold character outlines with strong linework
- Blade Runner 2049 / sci-fi noir aesthetic - dystopian, moody, rain-soaked
- Multiverse concept: character in alternate reality, speaking across dimensions
- **Film grain / VHS texture** - heavy analog texture throughout
- **Slight blur / bloom effect** around lights - nostalgic, not sharp
- **Atmospheric particles**: fog, rain, dust creating depth
- **Retro-future tech**: CRT monitors, analog UI, vintage displays, rotary phones
- "Future imagined from the past" - 80s/90s vision of dystopian future
- Dark backgrounds with diffused neon accents (NOT sharp, always through atmosphere)
- **High contrast but ATMOSPHERIC** - deep blacks with glowing neon halos
- Dystopian scale in background (towering megacity, rain-soaked streets)
- Warm intimate lighting on character within cold harsh world

COMPOSITION RULES (CRITICAL - KEEP IT CLEAN):
- **NO holographic displays, floating interfaces, or tech panels** (too overused, not Blade Runner)
- DO NOT show phone/laptop screens with visible content
- DO NOT scatter multiple props (no "surrounded by coffee cups/books/items")
- Minimal props: ONE key object maximum
- Focus on CHARACTER and ENVIRONMENT (streets, rain, neon signs)
- Clean, uncluttered compositions that feel natural and cinematic
- Describe the FEELING and ATMOSPHERE, not literal tech elements
- **Blade Runner = streets + neon + rain, NOT clean apartments + holograms**

SOFT DYSTOPIA ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:
MUST INCLUDE BOTH:
1. DYSTOPIAN ELEMENTS:
   - Towering megacity scale, overwhelming urban density
   - Heavy rain or wet surfaces with reflections
   - Nighttime/perpetual darkness atmosphere
   - Industrial, oppressive architecture
   - Tech everywhere (CRT monitors, screens, cables, analog UI)

2. WARM INTIMATE ELEMENTS:
   - Small human spaces within vast city (phone booth, bus stop shelter, diner booth)
   - Warm light sources: tungsten lamps, interior lights, street lamps casting amber glow
   - Analog/retro tech creating nostalgia (CRT vibes, rotary phones, vintage machines)
   - Sense of shelter, hope, softness despite harsh environment
   - Steam from vents, warm interior glow through windows

ENVIRONMENT EXAMPLES:
Streets: Rain-soaked dark alleys with DIFFUSED blue neon through fog + WARM amber streetlamp creating refuge, phone booth with warm interior light in cold rainy street, bus stop shelter lit by warm tungsten against cold megacity
Rooftops/Elevated: Fire escape with warm hanging bulb overlooking COLD rain-soaked cityscape, rooftop under rain with warm shelter light, elevated walkway with character in pool of warm light
Indoor Refuges: Retro diner booth with WARM amber lighting + COLD neon city through rain-streaked window, laundromat with vintage machines and CRT TV glow, small apartment with warm lamp + towering megacity visible outside

AVOID: Clean modern spaces, holographic displays, sterile interfaces, bright lighting, sunny scenes
FOCUS: Gritty dystopian street-level with small warm refuges, diffused neon through rain/fog, analog retro tech, film grain, atmospheric haze

LIGHTING PHILOSOPHY - "Cold World, Warm Soul":
- Warm tungsten/amber light on character's face (ALWAYS, even in cold environments)
- Neon signs DIFFUSED through rain/fog (never sharp or harsh)
- "The world is harsh, but you're safe here" - lighting conveys this
- Background: Cold blue/gray/purple neon creating dystopian atmosphere
- Foreground: Warm orange/amber/tungsten light creating refuge on character
- Practical NEON TUBE lighting with atmospheric diffusion, CRT glow, analog imperfections
- Rain-reflective surfaces, volumetric light rays, heavy atmospheric haze
- Film grain texture, VHS noise, slight bloom effect
- ANALOG WARMTH: imperfect glows, color bleed, nostalgic vintage feel (NOT digital perfection)

ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY - END EVERY IMAGE PROMPT WITH THIS EXACT TEXT:
"Blade Runner 2049 soft dystopia aesthetic - cold world, warm soul. Flat graphic anime style with DIFFUSED neon through rain/fog (never sharp), moody sci-fi atmosphere.

❌ BAD: "bright hopeful future with clean environment"
✅ GOOD: "overwhelming dystopian cityscape at night with rain, but character in warm amber-lit refuge - cold world, warm soul"

❌ BAD: "sharp bright neon signs in clear night"
✅ GOOD: "neon signs diffused through heavy rain and fog, creating atmospheric glow - never sharp or harsh"

❌ BAD: "uniformly cold blue cyberpunk with no warmth"
✅ GOOD: "80% cold navy/charcoal environment + 20% warm amber/orange on character's face - essential contrast"

❌ BAD: "character in sterile modern apartment with holographic displays"
✅ GOOD: "character in small retro diner booth under warm tungsten light, towering rain-soaked megacity visible through window, CRT TV glowing nearby"

❌ BAD: "character in purple jacket affected by location lighting"
✅ GOOD: "The same character in their dark coat, face illuminated by warm amber lamp, cold blue neon diffused in rainy background"

❌ BAD: "bright daytime city street with sunshine"
✅ GOOD: "nighttime rain-soaked alley with diffused cyan neon overhead, warm orange streetlamp creating pool of light around character"

❌ BAD: "dramatic action scene with movement"
✅ GOOD: "quiet contemplative moment - character standing still in phone booth with warm interior light, cold rainy megacity beyond glass"

❌ BAD: "clean modern tech everywhere"
✅ GOOD: "retro analog tech - CRT monitors with green phosphor glow, vintage rotary phone, worn machines with character and soul"

❌ BAD: "no atmosphere, clean and clear"
✅ GOOD: "heavy atmospheric haze, film grain, rain particles, fog diffusing neon, VHS texture throughout - future imagined from the past"

Keep it DYSTOPIAN yet INTIMATE - overwhelming harsh world with small warm human refuges. Focus on the "cold world, warm soul" emotional contrast.
