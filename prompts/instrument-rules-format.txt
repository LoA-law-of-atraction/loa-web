# Instrument rules format for music prompt generation
# LOA music concept: existential, sentimental, retro-futuristic noir.
# Heavy and emotionally weighty, not wellness.

primary_label=PRIMARY (sustained analog synth pad — main harmonic voice)
secondary_label=SECONDARY (low harmonic pad / drone — subtle support for weight and depth)
conditional_label=CONDITIONAL (soft felt piano — distant, sparse sustained chords only; no melody)
forbidden_label=DO NOT USE

fallback_empty=Film score aesthetic, not meditation or wellness. Sustained analog synth pads in minor key, emotionally heavy and restrained, subtle harmonic tension, nocturnal cold urban undertone, metallic restraint. No rhythm, no drums, no vocals, no melody.

closing=If more than two instruments are noticeable, it is wrong. Sustained, static, emotionally weighty — unresolved and inevitable. Solitary, not soothing. No cinematic builds, no tension arcs, no relaxation intent.
