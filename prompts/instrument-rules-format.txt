# Instrument rules format (fallback when no instruments loaded)
# Piano = emotional lead. Pads = world. LOA music concept: existential, sentimental, retro-futuristic noir.

primary_label=PRIMARY (soft felt piano — emotional lead, carries chord progression)
secondary_label=SECONDARY (analog synth pad — creates world/atmosphere behind piano)
conditional_label=CONDITIONAL (low harmonic pad/drone — optional, 10–20% max)
forbidden_label=DO NOT USE

fallback_empty=Piano-led: soft felt piano carries chord progression and harmonic movement, expressive but restrained. Analog synth pads create depth and atmosphere behind the piano, sustain and move slowly. Minor key, emotionally heavy and restrained, subtle harmonic tension, nocturnal cold urban undertone. No rhythm, no drums, no vocals, no melodic lead. Harmonic storytelling, not melodic performance.

closing=Piano leads harmonically and emotionally; pads create the world behind it. Sustained, intimate, nocturnal. No cinematic builds, no tension arcs, no relaxation intent.
