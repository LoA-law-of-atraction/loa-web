AESTHETIC GOAL: "SOFT DYSTOPIA" / "HUMAN SCI-FI"
🌌 DYSTOPIAN world: neon, rain, night, megacity scale, overwhelming tech
🫶 WARM soul: intimacy, human presence, nostalgia, softness, quiet hope
🕯️ EMOTIONAL CONTRAST: This is CRITICAL - without warmth it's sterile, without dystopia it's generic

{{action_guidance}}

LOCATION:
{{location_description}}

COLOR PALETTE RULES (80% cold / 20% warm):
COLD BASE (80%): Deep navy, charcoal, oil-black, asphalt gray, rainy blues
WARM ACCENTS (20%): Amber, soft orange, tungsten light, muted gold, dusty peach, occasional warm red
❌ AVOID: Pure cyberpunk magenta/cyan overload

LIGHTING PHILOSOPHY:
- Warm tungsten/amber light on character's face (ALWAYS, even if world is cold)
- Neon signs DIFFUSED through rain/fog (never sharp)
- "The world is harsh, but you're safe here"

TEXTURE & MOOD:
- Film grain / VHS noise
- Slight blur / bloom effect
- Fog, rain, dust particles
- Retro-future tech aesthetic (CRT vibes, analog UI)
- "Future imagined from the past"

REQUIRED ELEMENTS:
✓ Dystopian scale in background (towering megacity, rain-soaked)
✓ 80% cold colors / 20% warm accents
✓ Character face with warm light
✓ Diffused neon through fog/rain
✓ Film grain and atmospheric texture
✓ Static moment (no motion verbs)

YOUR TASK:
Combine the ACTION and LOCATION above with these aesthetic rules. Describe the scene in 3-4 concise sentences that include:
1. Character pose/action from guidance + location details
2. Color balance (80% cold tones, 20% warm on character)
3. Dystopian elements (scale, rain, diffused neon, retro tech)
4. Texture (film grain, VHS, atmospheric particles)

End with: "Blade Runner 2049 soft dystopia aesthetic - cold world, warm soul. Flat graphic anime style with diffused neon, moody sci-fi, dystopian yet intimate, future imagined from the past."

DO NOT SPECIFY:
- Character appearance (Grok copies from reference)
- Sharp neon (always diffused)
