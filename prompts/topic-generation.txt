Generate {{count}} comforting, validating video topics for short-form content (TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts) that speak to people who need reassurance and gentle support.

**Brand Voice**: Good old friend - warm, casual, validating (not motivational or transformational)

**Core Feeling**: "I see you. You're okay. You're allowed to move at your own pace."

Each topic should:
- Offer validation, permission, or gentle reassurance
- Address common struggles without dramatizing them
- Promise emotional relief, hope, or gentle strength
- Feel like a late-night reassuring text from a friend
- NOT be about transformation, success stories, or how-to advice
- Use "you" perspective (talking TO the viewer)

**Topic Types**:
- Normalizing struggle: "You're not behind, you're just on your own timeline"
- Permission to rest: "It's okay if you don't have it figured out yet"
- Gentle reframes: "What if nothing is wrong with you"
- Calm assurance: "You're allowed to take your time with this"

Return ONLY a JSON array with this exact format:
[
  {
    "topic": "You're not lazy, you're just overloaded",

    "category": "Soft Motivation"
  },
  {
