A TOPIC is provided externally. Do NOT repeat or restate it.

A SELECTED CHARACTER is provided externally as JSON with:
- character_id
- gender (male/female)
- age_range (e.g., 20s/30s)
- image_url (reference image)
- voice_id (ElevenLabs voice ID)

Task:
Use the provided character to create a short motivational video script inspired by a real-feeling Law of Attraction success story aligned tightly to the given topic.

Create exactly {{scene_count}} scenes (8 seconds each) that will be generated independently with TWO distinct locations to show visual transformation.

WORKFLOW:
1. Generate STATIC IMAGE for each scene (text-to-image)
2. User approves images in editor
3. Animate approved images into 8-second videos (image-to-video)

SCRIPT RULES:
- Motivational, grounded, calm confidence (not hype)
- Anonymized: no names, companies, locations, or dates
- Show struggle → inner shift → positive outcome
- No direct teaching ("you should…")
- Voiceover pacing must feel natural and unhurried
- Generate ONE CONTINUOUS SCRIPT ({{scene_count}} × 8 seconds = total duration) that flows naturally

PAUSE PLACEMENT (CRITICAL):
Add natural pauses throughout the script using these markers:
- [pause:1s] or [pause:2s] or [pause:500ms] for specific durations
- [pause] for default 1 second pause

Place pauses where a human narrator would naturally pause:
✓ After complete thoughts or sentences (1-1.5s)
✓ Before introducing a new idea or shift (1.5-2s)
✓ After rhetorical questions or reflective moments (1-2s)
✓ Between major story beats or emotional shifts (2s)
✓ For dramatic emphasis before key realizations (1.5-2s)
✓ Between location transitions (scene changes) (2s)

Example with natural pauses:
"She sat in the dim light, wondering if anything would ever change. [pause:1.5s] The doubt had been there for months. [pause] But tonight... [pause:2s] tonight felt different. [pause:1s]"

DO NOT over-pause - keep it natural and conversational. Aim for 4-6 pauses total in a 32-second script.

ENDING RULE (IMPORTANT):
The final scene MUST end with a quietly empowering realization that implies forward motion, self-trust, or inner alignment.
The ending should feel like "something has unlocked", not advice or instruction.
Avoid clichés and commands; keep it subtle, confident, and emotionally affirming.

SCENE STRUCTURE (TWO LOCATIONS):
Note: Adapt this structure to {{scene_count}} total scenes, dividing them roughly equally between two locations.
- First half of scenes: FIRST LOCATION (e.g., indoor/night - struggle/reflection)
- Second half of scenes: SECOND LOCATION (e.g., outdoor/dawn - breakthrough/resolution)
- Location change represents visual transformation/shift
- Maintain consistency WITHIN each location pair

Example for 4 scenes:
- Scenes 1-2: FIRST LOCATION
- Scenes 3-4: SECOND LOCATION

VISUAL PROGRESSION (Example for 4 scenes - adapt to {{scene_count}}):
- First half: Struggle/reflection in Location 1
- Second half: Breakthrough/resolution in Location 2 (NEW)
- Progression should show: struggle → shift → clarity → resolution

VISUAL CONSISTENCY RULES (CRITICAL):

GLOBAL CONSISTENCY (ALL 4 SCENES):
1. Character appearance (gender + age_range from provided character)
2. Overall visual style (dark cinematic cartoon style throughout)
3. Style keywords (heavy shadows, thick outlines, VHS grain, etc.)

WITHIN EACH LOCATION PAIR:
Scenes 1-2 must share:
- Exact same environment description
- Same time of day
- Same color palette
- Same lighting setup

Scenes 3-4 must share:
- Exact same environment description
- Same time of day (can be different from Scenes 1-2)
- Same color palette (can be different from Scenes 1-2)
- Same lighting setup

LOCATION TRANSITION EXAMPLES:
✅ Indoor bedroom (dark/night) → Outdoor rooftop (dawn/golden hour)
✅ Dimly lit apartment (evening) → Open balcony (sunrise)
✅ Confined interior space (shadows) → Expansive outdoor view (light)
✅ Dark room alone → City street at dawn
✅ Bedroom window view → Standing outside in daylight

PROMPT WRITING RULES (CRITICAL):

You must generate TWO prompts for each scene:

1. IMAGE_PROMPT (for text-to-image generation):
   - Describes a STATIC FRAME (like a photograph)
   - No motion words (no "walking", "moving", "turning")
   - Describes a frozen moment in time
   - Clear pose and expression
   - Complete environment description

2. MOTION_PROMPT (for image-to-video animation):
   - Describes the SUBTLE MOVEMENT to animate
   - Keep it simple and natural
   - No dramatic actions
   - Examples: "slowly lifts head", "eyes open gently", "slight smile emerges", "gentle head turn"

IMAGE PROMPT STRUCTURE:
1. Start: "Dark cinematic cartoon style"
2. Describe: Character's frozen pose/expression in environment
3. Environment: Exact same within each pair (1-2, 3-4)
4. Style keywords: Same across all 4 scenes
5. Color palette: Same within each pair
6. End with: "Vertical 9:16, single frame, no motion"

MOTION PROMPT RULES:
- Keep motions SUBTLE and natural
- 8-second duration
- Avoid dramatic movements
- Examples:
  ✅ "Slowly lifts head and opens eyes, slight change in expression"
  ✅ "Gentle head turn toward the window, eyes focusing"
  ✅ "Subtle smile emerges, slight shift in posture showing confidence"
  ✅ "Calm breathing motion, eyes opening gradually"
  ❌ "Stands up and walks across the room" (too dramatic)
  ❌ "Jumps and celebrates" (too energetic)

STYLE KEYWORDS TO USE (SAME IN ALL 4 SCENES):
- "heavy shadows", "thick outlines", "thick linework", "detailed linework"
- "VHS grain", "VHS effect", "vintage textures"
- "muted colors", "muted [color] tones"
- "neon glow", "neon reflections", "faint neon"
- "noir lighting", "noir comic aesthetic", "dramatic lighting"
- "eerie surreal atmosphere", "eerie calm", "mysterious atmosphere"

EXAMPLE SUCCESSFUL PROMPTS (WITH LOCATION CHANGE):

Scene 1 (Location 1 - Indoor/Night):
IMAGE_PROMPT: "Dark cinematic cartoon style. A woman in her 30s sits in a dimly lit bedroom at night, head lowered, eyes closed, hands resting on her lap. Shadows fall across her face and body. Faint neon glow from a window casts purple and blue tones. Heavy linework, thick outlines, VHS grain, muted colors. Twilight sky visible outside. Mysterious, quiet, emotionally still. Vertical 9:16, single frame, no motion. Noir comic aesthetic with vintage texture and eerie surreal atmosphere."

MOTION_PROMPT: "Slow breathing motion, head remains lowered. Subtle shadows shifting across face. Calm, meditative stillness with gentle atmospheric movement."

Scene 2 (Location 1 - Same Indoor/Night):
IMAGE_PROMPT: "Dark cinematic cartoon style. A woman in her 30s sits in a dimly lit bedroom at night, head slightly lifted, eyes beginning to open, hands still resting on her lap. Shadows fall across her face and body. Faint neon glow from a window casts purple and blue tones. Heavy linework, thick outlines, VHS grain, muted colors. Twilight sky visible outside. Subtle emotional shift, mysterious calm. Vertical 9:16, single frame, no motion. Noir comic aesthetic with vintage texture and eerie surreal atmosphere."

MOTION_PROMPT: "Slowly lifts head further and opens eyes completely, gaze shifting toward the window. Subtle change in posture showing emerging awareness. Gentle, gradual movement."

Scene 3 (Location 2 - Outdoor/Dawn - NEW):
IMAGE_PROMPT: "Dark cinematic cartoon style. A woman in her 30s stands on a rooftop at dawn, looking at the horizon, relaxed posture, hands at sides, city skyline behind her. Warm golden and amber tones from sunrise mix with fading night. Heavy linework, thick outlines, VHS grain, muted colors. Dawn sky with soft light breaking through. Growing awareness, calm certainty. Vertical 9:16, single frame, no motion. Noir comic aesthetic with vintage texture and peaceful atmosphere."

MOTION_PROMPT: "Gentle breathing, slight wind moving through hair and clothes. Eyes scanning the horizon slowly. Peaceful, contemplative stillness with subtle atmospheric movement."

Scene 4 (Location 2 - Same Outdoor/Dawn):
IMAGE_PROMPT: "Dark cinematic cartoon style. A woman in her 30s stands on a rooftop at dawn, gazing forward with quiet confidence, subtle smile on her face, hands relaxed at sides, city skyline behind her. Warm golden and amber tones from sunrise mix with fading night. Heavy linework, thick outlines, VHS grain, muted colors. Dawn sky with soft light breaking through. Inner alignment, emotional resonance. Vertical 9:16, single frame, no motion. Noir comic aesthetic with vintage texture and peaceful atmosphere."

MOTION_PROMPT: "Slight smile grows subtly, gentle head turn as if taking in the moment. Calm, confident presence. Soft wind and atmospheric movement showing inner peace."

KEY REQUIREMENTS:

- Scenes 3-4: EXACT SAME environment, time, color palette (but different from 1-2)
