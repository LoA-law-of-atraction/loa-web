A TOPIC is provided externally. Do NOT repeat or restate it.

A SELECTED CHARACTER is provided externally as JSON with:
- character_id
- gender (male/female)
- age_range (e.g., 20s/30s)
- image_url (reference image)
- voice_id (ElevenLabs voice ID)

Task:
Use the provided character to create a comforting, validating video script that addresses the given topic with gentle reassurance and quiet strength.

Create exactly {{scene_count}} scenes (8 seconds each) that will be generated independently with TWO distinct locations to show emotional shift from struggle to reassurance.

CHARACTER-SPECIFIC STORYTELLING (CRITICAL):
The story MUST be tailored to the character's age and gender to feel authentic and relatable:

**Consider the character's life stage:**
- 20s: Early career, finding direction, comparison with peers, proving yourself, entry-level struggles
- 30s: Career/life transitions, balancing responsibilities, established but questioning, "is this it?" moments
- 40s: Reinvention, accumulated wisdom, midlife recalibration, letting go of old patterns
- 50s+: New chapters, confidence from experience, redefining success, freedom from others' opinions

**Consider gender-relevant experiences:**
- Women often face: people-pleasing, seeking permission, being "too much" or "not enough", perfectionism, invisible labor
- Men often face: pressure to have it all figured out, hiding vulnerability, proving worth through achievement, fear of appearing weak

**Use age/gender-appropriate scenarios:**
Example for woman in 30s: workplace dynamics, relationship boundaries, juggling multiple roles, societal expectations
Example for man in 20s: career uncertainty, comparison with successful peers, pressure to appear confident, proving capability

The situations, language, and challenges should feel REAL and SPECIFIC to someone of this age and gender.

WORKFLOW:
1. Generate STATIC IMAGE for each scene (text-to-image)
2. User approves images in editor
3. Animate approved images into 8-second videos (image-to-video)

SCRIPT RULES - "GOOD OLD FRIEND" VOICE:

**Core Energy**: A good old friend who's been there
- Doesn't lecture or motivate aggressively
- Doesn't sound polished or performed
- Sounds like: "Yeah... I've been there." / "You're okay. Really."

**The Feeling**:
- Late-night text messages
- A walk home together
- Someone remembering your struggles

**Emotional Promise** (deliver ONE of these):
- 😌 Relief — "You're not broken"
- 🌱 Hope — "This can still work out"
- 🔥 Gentle strength — "You don't have to rush this"

**Voice Requirements**:
- **Use "YOU" and "WE"** (talking TO the viewer like a friend)
- ❌ DON'T use: "I", "she", "he" (not a personal testimony)
- Casual, slightly imperfect, warm and grounded
- NO performance energy - keep it conversational
- Use pauses naturally
- Incomplete thoughts are okay ("Honestly...", "And that's...")
- **AVOID single-word sentences** at the end (they sound like questions in TTS)
  - ❌ "And that's okay. Really." (sounds questioning)
  - ✅ "And that's really okay." or "And you know what? That's okay."
- **BE CONCISE**: Every word must earn its place
- Generate ONE CONTINUOUS SCRIPT ({{scene_count}} × 8 seconds = total duration)

**Good Old Friend Phrases** (use these):
✅ "Honestly..."
✅ "It's okay if you don't know yet."
✅ "You're not wrong for feeling this way."
✅ "We'll figure it out."
✅ "You're okay. Really."
✅ "You don't have to rush this."

**Never Say** (too teachy/formal):
❌ "You should..."
❌ "Here's how to..."
❌ "Studies show..."
❌ "The key is..."
❌ "You need to..."

TOPIC ALIGNMENT (CRITICAL):
- Address the topic with VALIDATION and REASSURANCE, not transformation
- Extract the core struggle or feeling from the topic
- Example: "victim mentality to CEO energy" → "I used to think I needed permission. I learned I don't."
- Focus on NORMALIZING the struggle and offering GENTLE REFRAMING
- The message should feel like: "You're not alone, and you're allowed to move at your own pace"

CONTENT PILLARS (choose one):

① GENTLE REALITY - Normalize struggle
- Acknowledge what's hard without making it dramatic
- Remove self-blame from the narrative
- Examples: "I thought I was behind. I was just on my own timeline."

② SOFT MOTIVATION - Permission to rest
- Motivation without urgency or pressure
- Reassure that slow progress is still progress
- Examples: "I learned rest isn't a setback. It's part of the process."

③ REFRAMING THOUGHTS - Mental relief
- Simple mindset shifts with no teaching tone
- Question old beliefs gently
- Examples: "What if nothing was wrong with me? What if I was just figuring it out?"

④ CALM ASSURANCE - Emotional safety
- Like a reassuring voice memo to yourself
- Based on truth, not fake affirmations
- Examples: "I gave myself permission to take my time. And that changed everything."

STORYTELLING STRUCTURE:
ACKNOWLEDGMENT (First half - ~40% of script):
- Name what they're going through - validate the struggle
- Use "you" to speak directly to them
- Make it specific and relatable - ADD DETAILS
- Don't rush this section - let it breathe
- Example: "You've been putting everyone else first for so long. [pause] And honestly, you're exhausted from trying to keep up."

GENTLE TRUTH (Midpoint - ~30% of script):
- Offer a reframe or gentle perspective shift
- Use "we" to show you're in it together
- ✅ GOOD PHRASES: "Maybe...", "What if...", "Here's the thing..."
- Develop the thought - don't just state it
- Example: "Here's the thing... You're not broken. You're just figuring it out. And that takes time."

REASSURANCE (Second half - ~30% of script):
- Offer permission and validation - EXPAND this
- Remind them they're okay as they are
- Use repetition for emphasis and length
- End with: "You're allowed to..." / "It's okay if..." / "We'll figure it out."
- Example: "You're allowed to take your time with this. You don't have to rush. [pause] And that's okay. Really."
- Make viewers feel SEEN and SAFE

Example tone:
❌ First person: "I learned it's okay to say no"
✅ Good friend: "It's okay to say no. Even when it feels uncomfortable. You're allowed to take your time with this."

CHARACTER LIMIT (CRITICAL - DO NOT IGNORE):
- Total video duration: {{scene_count}} × 8 = {{total_seconds}} seconds
- REQUIRED script length: {{max_characters}} characters (including pause markers)
- Based on natural speaking rate with pauses (~12 chars/second)

⚠️ LENGTH REQUIREMENT - CRITICAL:
- ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM: {{max_characters}} characters (including [pause] markers)
- TARGET RANGE: {{min_characters}}-{{max_characters}} characters (85-100% of limit)
- Scripts OVER {{max_characters}} characters will be REJECTED
- Scripts under {{min_characters}} characters will be REJECTED as too short

**How to hit the target length:**
- CASUAL doesn't mean SHORT - you still need to fill {{total_seconds}} seconds
- Expand thoughts with natural details and pauses
- Add conversational elaboration: "And honestly... that's okay."
- Use repetition for emphasis: "You're okay. Really, you're okay."
- Don't rush - let thoughts breathe and develop
- Each pause is ~7 characters, use 3-4 of them

Example length for reference:
- 4 scenes (32s) = 330-384 characters MINIMUM
- This is roughly 50-60 words with natural pauses
- Casual voice should still be SUBSTANTIAL, not brief

Example of right length (4 scenes):
"You've been putting everyone else first for so long. [pause] And honestly, you're exhausted. [pause] Here's the thing... you're allowed to take your time with this. You're allowed to figure it out at your own pace. [pause] You don't have to have it all figured out right now. And that's okay. Really."
(~290 characters - add more detail to reach 330+)

PAUSE PLACEMENT (CRITICAL):
Add natural pauses throughout the script using the [pause] marker (1 second duration).

Place pauses where a human narrator would naturally pause:
✓ After complete thoughts or sentences
✓ Before introducing a new idea or shift
✓ After rhetorical questions or reflective moments
✓ Between major story beats or emotional shifts
✓ For dramatic emphasis before key realizations
✓ Between location transitions (scene changes)

Example with natural pauses:
"She sat in the dim light, wondering if anything would ever change. [pause] The doubt had been there for months. [pause] But tonight... [pause] tonight felt different."

DO NOT over-pause - keep it natural and conversational. Aim for 3-4 pauses total in a 32-second script (fewer for shorter videos).

ENDING RULE (IMPORTANT):
The final scene MUST deliver REASSURANCE and PERMISSION, not achievement.
End with one of these feelings:
- "You're allowed to..." (permission)
- "It's okay if..." (validation)
- "You don't need to..." (relief from pressure)

**Ending Structure for TTS:**
- ❌ DON'T end with single-word affirmations: "Really.", "Truly.", "Always."
- ✅ DO integrate affirmations into sentences: "And that's really okay." / "You're truly allowed to take your time."
- Make the LAST sentence feel like a complete, reassuring statement
- Avoid sentence fragments at the very end

The ending should feel like a gentle exhale - emotional safety, not motivation.
Avoid transformation language; focus on self-acceptance and being okay where you are.

SCENE STRUCTURE:
Total scenes: {{scene_count}}
Location distribution: Divide scenes evenly across {{location_count}} locations

Example distribution patterns:
- 4 scenes, 2 locations: Scenes 1-2 (Location 1), Scenes 3-4 (Location 2)
- 4 scenes, 3 locations: Scenes 1-2 (Location 1), Scene 3 (Location 2), Scene 4 (Location 3)
- 6 scenes, 2 locations: Scenes 1-3 (Location 1), Scenes 4-6 (Location 2)
- 6 scenes, 3 locations: Scenes 1-2 (Location 1), Scenes 3-4 (Location 2), Scenes 5-6 (Location 3)

Location changes represent emotional/narrative shifts.
Within each location group, maintain exact same environment - only vary character pose/expression.

VISUAL PROGRESSION (Example for 4 scenes - adapt to {{scene_count}}):
- Scene 1: Struggle/doubt
- Scene 2: Questioning/reflection
- Scene 3: Awareness/shift
- Scene 4: Resolution/acceptance

VISUAL CONSISTENCY RULES (CRITICAL):

GLOBAL CONSISTENCY (ALL SCENES):
1. Character appearance (gender + age_range from provided character)
2. Overall visual style (cinematic sci-fi/Blade Runner aesthetic throughout)
3. Style keywords (neon lighting, rain, street-level urban environments, atmospheric haze, film grain, etc.)

LOCATION STRUCTURE:
Mode: {{location_mode}}
Total Locations: {{location_count}}

Divide {{scene_count}} scenes across {{location_count}} different locations as evenly as possible.
Scenes sharing the same location must have:
- Exact same environment description
- Same time of day
- Same color palette
- Same lighting setup
- Only character pose/expression changes between scenes in same location

If {{location_mode}} = "all_different":
- Each scene has a unique location
- Show emotional progression through changing environments

LOCATION TRANSITION EXAMPLES (BLADE RUNNER STREET-LEVEL):
✅ Dark alleyway with neon signs → Rooftop edge overlooking neon city
✅ Rain-soaked street corner with vendors → Empty elevated walkway at night
✅ Dimly lit bar interior → Outdoor fire escape with city view
✅ Narrow backstreet with steam vents → Wide pedestrian crossing with neon ads
✅ Covered market with neon lights → Open plaza with towering billboards

PROMPT WRITING RULES (CRITICAL):

You must generate TWO prompts for each scene:

1. IMAGE_PROMPT (for text-to-image generation):
   - Describes a STATIC FRAME (like a photograph)
   - No motion words (no "walking", "moving", "turning")
   - Describes a frozen moment in time
   - Clear pose and expression
   - Complete environment description

2. MOTION_PROMPT (for image-to-video animation):
   - Describes the SUBTLE MOVEMENT to animate
   - Keep it simple and natural
   - No dramatic actions
   - Examples: "slowly lifts head", "eyes open gently", "slight smile emerges", "gentle head turn"

IMAGE PROMPT STRUCTURE (for /edit endpoint):
1. Start: "The same character"
2. Describe: Character's frozen pose/expression in environment
3. Environment: Exact same within each pair (1-2, 3-4)
4. Follow all visual style, composition, and lighting rules (see below)
5. **CRITICAL:** ALWAYS end with the mandatory style description (see shared rules below)

**ENVIRONMENT GUIDELINES - COZY CINEMATIC NOIR:**
Create intimate, comforting spaces rendered in dark, stylized cinematic aesthetic:

{{include:image-prompt-shared-rules}}

MOTION PROMPT RULES:
- Keep motions SUBTLE and natural
- 8-second duration
- Avoid dramatic movements
- Examples:
  ✅ "Slowly lifts head and opens eyes, slight change in expression"
  ✅ "Gentle head turn toward the window, eyes focusing"
  ✅ "Subtle smile emerges, slight shift in posture showing confidence"
  ✅ "Calm breathing motion, eyes opening gradually"
  ❌ "Stands up and walks across the room" (too dramatic)
  ❌ "Jumps and celebrates" (too energetic)
