Generate a DARK CINEMATIC image prompt for a video scene based on this voiceover:

"{{voiceover}}"

CRITICAL STRUCTURE - Follow this EXACT format:
1. CHARACTER FIRST: "The same character [VARIED POSE/ACTIVITY + expression matching voiceover]"
2. THEN LOCATION: "in [location setting]"
3. BACKGROUND DETAILS: Describe the environment/lighting AROUND the character, not ON the character

POSE/ACTIVITY VARIETY (CRITICAL - VARY THESE, DON'T ALWAYS USE "STANDING"):
- Sitting: on bench, at table, on steps, in booth, on ledge, cross-legged
- Leaning: against wall, on railing, against door frame, on counter
- Looking/Watching: gazing out window, watching rain, looking at phone, examining object, staring into distance
- Listening: head tilted listening to rain, listening to old jukebox, contemplative listening
- Interacting: hands on railing, touching glass, holding cup, resting hand on wall
- Contemplative: sitting with chin on hand, leaning with arms crossed, standing but slouched
- Waiting: seated waiting, leaning while waiting, looking down the street
- DO NOT default to "standing with hands in pockets" - use creative varied poses!

LOCATION FOR BACKGROUND:
{{location_description}}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- The character's APPEARANCE (clothing, colors, design) must stay EXACTLY the same as reference
- Character's DARK COAT must remain DARK (charcoal/dark gray) - NOT pink, NOT purple, NOT magenta
- Rim lighting (pink/magenta/cyan) is ONLY edge highlights/glow on character outline - NOT the coat color itself
- Location lighting and colors affect ONLY the background/environment, NOT the character's clothing colors
- {{consistency_instruction}}
- Describe a STATIC frozen moment (no motion words like "walking" or "moving")
- VARY THE POSE/ACTIVITY - don't repeat the same pose across scenes
- Include character's expression that matches the voiceover emotion
- Match activity to location (sitting in diner, leaning in phone booth, waiting at bus stop)
- Focus on MOOD and ATMOSPHERE in the BACKGROUND
- Keep compositions CLEAN and SIMPLE - avoid cluttered props
- NO holographic displays, NO floating interfaces, NO tech panels
- FLAT GRAPHIC ANIME style with HARD EDGES and SIMPLE CEL-SHADING - NOT painterly, NOT soft
