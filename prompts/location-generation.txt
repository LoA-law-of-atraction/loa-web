Generate {count} unique "SOFT DYSTOPIA" location(s) for a Blade Runner 2049-style video project.

AESTHETIC CONCEPT: "SOFT DYSTOPIA" / "HUMAN SCI-FI"
🌌 DYSTOPIAN world: overwhelming megacity, rain-soaked, nighttime, industrial tech everywhere
🫶 WARM soul: intimate human refuges, analog nostalgia, quiet hope within harsh world
🕯️ EMOTIONAL CONTRAST: "Cold world, warm soul" - this is CRITICAL

VISUAL LANGUAGE:
- Future imagined from the past: analog tech, CRT glow, retro-future aesthetic
- Film grain, VHS texture, slight bloom, atmospheric particles
- NOT sterile modern sci-fi - 80s/90s vision of dystopian future
- Dystopian scale but human intimacy

COLOR PALETTE (80% cold / 20% warm):
COLD BASE (80%): Deep navy, charcoal, oil-black, asphalt gray, rainy blues
WARM ACCENTS (20%): Amber, soft orange, tungsten light, muted gold, dusty peach, occasional warm red
❌ AVOID: Pure cyberpunk magenta/cyan overload

LIGHTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Diffused neon through rain/fog (never sharp)
- Warm tungsten/amber light sources in intimate spaces
- Cold blue/gray dominant, warm orange/amber accents
- "The world is harsh, but you're safe here"

DYSTOPIAN ELEMENTS (must include):
- Towering megacity scale, overwhelming urban density
- Heavy rain or wet surfaces with reflections
- Nighttime/perpetual darkness
- Industrial, oppressive architecture
- Tech everywhere (CRT monitors, screens, cables, analog UI)

WARM ELEMENTS (must balance):
- Small intimate human spaces within vast city
- Warm light sources: window glow, street lamps, interior lights
- Analog/retro tech creating nostalgia (CRT vibes)
- Sense of shelter, hope, softness despite harsh environment

REQUIREMENTS:
- Gritty, street-level urban environments (NOT clean spaces)
- Each location must show BOTH dystopian scale AND warm intimacy
- Rich sensory details: lighting, atmosphere, textures
- Intimate, contemplative spaces for quiet human moments
- Rain, fog, or atmospheric particles preferred
